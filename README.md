This Android application uses [TensorFlow Lite](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite) to identify **specific buildings and landmarks** in North America from live video. It leverages a `.tflite` model to perform on-device image classification, enabling **fast**, **private**, and **offline** landmark recognition directly on the user's device.

## ü§ñ AI & Machine Learning

This app showcases **mobile machine learning** using **TensorFlow Lite**. The model was trained on a curated dataset of well-known North American landmarks and optimized for deployment on Android.

This project demonstrates the practical application of **mobile artificial intelligence** using TensorFlow Lite. A custom model, trained on a dataset of North American landmarks, enables the app to run lightweight, real-time image recognition entirely on Android devices.

TensorFlow Lite‚Äôs optimization for mobile performance allows the model to execute quickly and reliably, making it well-suited for use cases where speed, efficiency, and offline capability are critical.

## ‚ú® Features

- üì∏ Identifies landmarks and buildings across North America
- ‚ö° Uses TensorFlow Lite for on-device machine learning
- üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Works in real time using live video frames
- üì¥ Fully offline ‚Äî no data connection required
- üì± Optimized for mobile performance and size

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. The app captures frames from the camera in real time
2. Each frame is analyzed by the custom TensorFlow Lite model (`namerica.tflite`)
3. The model returns the most probable landmark along with a confidence score
4. The results are displayed in the app interface
